OUR EXPIRING COMMERCIAL TREATY WITH THE
BRAZILS.
The present unsettled state of our commercial relations with the
Brazilian Empire presents a subject of ‘more importance than any
other at this moment to our trading, and, we may add, to our social
existence ; for the comforts and welfare of so large a mass of our
people, whether engaged in agriculture or manufactures, have of late
been proved to depend so greatly on the existence of our foreign trade,
iiiat nothing materially affects the one which is not quickly felt by the
other. .
Before entering into the subject Wmucdiately under cousiaeration,
we will, by way of administering some admonitory experience, shortly
refer to what has occurred in our trade to the United States of Ame-
rica, within the last two or three years. By their former tariff
the duties imposed on our manufactures were on a scale which
was subject to gradual reduction, and in 1840 the rates had become
comparatively moderate. The great Southern States, growers of
cotton, dependent chiefly on this country for a market, and desirous
to obtain our manufactures in exchange, at the smaller price, were
always friendly to the lowest rates of duties; but, in the Northern
States, we had two of the largest and most important classes opposed
to an extension of trade with this country, and consequently to low
rates of duties. First,—the manufacturing classes of all kinds,
with whose products our goods came in competition; and, secondly,
the great agricultural classes, whose produce was practically nearly
excluded from this market. They felt that even the peculiar
construction of our scale of corn duties was as if designed to
exclude them particularly from any share of our trade, The
former class we had no means of appeasing, nor was it of much
consequence that we should; but the latter class we had the power of
doing so, not only greatly to their advantage, but also to our own; and
the neglect to listen to their case, so strongly and so frequently urged
upon the attention of the late Government, by individual friends of
free trade in this country, and also by our diplomatic agents in
America, not only as an act of justice to the consumer at home, but as
the only means by which our great trade with that country could be
maintained, threw at length much of the influence of the agricultural
body in the Northern States into that of the manufacturing body, in
antagonism with the trade of England. At their public meetings,
nay, even in the columns of our own daily journals, in articles written
by accredited agents of the parties most interested in a free trade with
us, the tone of argument was, that England adhered with so much té-
nacity to her protective and prohibitory laws, that it became needful
that America should, even against her own interest, submit to some
inconvenience, make some considerable temporary sacrifice of her own
admitted interests in obtaining the cheap goods of England, in order

was lost to them, and the manufacturers, whose only object was to
obtain a higher protection, had no diffi
they had better encourage the extension of their trade at home, by
paying even higher prices, and thus increase the only market they had
for their produce. Under these influences, which were operating for some
culty to persuade them that

ment, and strengthened by the political events which occurred in this
country in 1841—which stamped more and more our determination to
persevere in principles of restriction—the free-trade party in America
was so weakened, that their opponents were able to carry the present

as to the policy they would pursue towards England, they were of some great

spirit which had been so unequivocally manifested in the elections
here; and that, not as far as it showed a choice for this or
that man as leader, of this party or that party as predominant—
for these are at all times both to them and us of little importance
—but they looked, and had a right to look, intently, on the great
issues which the English public were called upon to try; which
simply were, extension or restriction, free trade or monopoly. We
decided in favour of the latter, and a country never felt more palpably
and instantly a punishment for an error, than in this instance ; 1

It has been customary, during the last year, when the bad state of trade
in the manufacturing districts, which so much depressed the demand and
price of agricultural produce, was attributed to the operation of the
Corn Laws and commercial restriction, to be told, No—it
the bad state of the American markets. Will people only take the
trouble to look beyond the proximate to the first cause.
It would be well for those agriculturists who hoisted the bann
monopoly in 1841, to consider what they lost in 1842, from th
pressed and ruined condition of their best consumers, arising out of
is caused by
the loss of the above 3,500,0001. value of theiz labour, We sincerely
believe that the agriculture of Great Britain would not have suffi red
even temporarily to the same extent which it did from this cause and
the general bad state of other trades partly arising therefrom, had the
whole system of protection been abolished, and the Corn Laws totally
repealed in 1841.
While these events have been going forward in North America, we
have had questions of not less importance raised respecting our rela-
tions in the Brazils, and in consequence of the extraordinary and un-
accountable apathy with which the country, even that portion whose
interests are most deeply and dangerously threatened, view all great
questions of commercial policy—it appears at present only too pro-
bable that the Government will be left quietly alane—to do nothing—
until the discussions end in a result ag disastrous in the South as they
haye done ia the North.
} ise
Our commercial relations with Brazil are of soextraordinary a kind,
and perhaps not well known to many of our readers, that it may be
needful shortly to explain them. On the 10th of November, 1827, we
ratified a treaty with that power for fifteen years, “ and furthe r until
one or other « F the high contracting parties shall give notice of tis termination.
In which case the treaty shall terminate at the end of two years from the
date of such notice.” By this treaty English manufactures were to be
admitted into the Brazils at the rate of the most favoured countries—
and at duties not to exceed fifteen per cent., ad valorem, but which du-
ties have in practice been raised by additional charges to about eighteen
and a half per cent. With this moderate duty ow expaet8"rapidly
increased, until that country has become the fourth largest foreign
market we have ; our exports annually amounting. to from 2,600,000.
to 3,000,0001. value of British manufactures. Here, then, is one of our
largest markets, in which we are treated with greater liberality than
we are by any other foreign powers, with very trivial exceptions. Let
us examine what treatment we have ‘given in return, The chief~
almost sole—produce of Brazil, excepting gold and silver, consists of—
SUGAR,
Correr, and
Corron Woot.

On the former'we impose a duty of 63s. per cwt., equal to 300 per cent.
on the value when landed in our docks, and equal to 150 per cent. above
the duty chargeable on sugars produced in our own colonies, which in
practice is quite prohibitory, and we consequently consume none of their
sugar. On their coffee, even by the new tariff, we impose a duty equal
to 200 per cent. on its value landed here, and equal to 100 per cent.
above the duty chargeable.gu coffee produced in our colonies, and we
consequently use little pr none of their coffee. On their cotton wool
we impose a moderaté duty (the same as on North American), and of
this article we import to a value under 250,000/, annually ; to which,
if we add a few other articles to a small extent, we may compute their
exports to this country for our consumption about 300,0001.
Thus a country from which we receive such liberal treatment, which
takes from us on the most favoured terms manufactures to the amount
of at least 2,600,000/. per annum, finds that we practically prohibit
from our consumption every important article which it produces,
except to the trifling amount of 300,000/. Let us conceive the case
reversed ;—imagine this country taking the produce of some other
country to the amount of 2,600,000/. annually, and that country, by
placing high prohibitory duties on our manufactures of 200 to 300 per
cent., consuming only to the extent of 300,000/. thereof, and then let
us conceive the indignation which such treatment would draw forth
from all parties in the country and the state.
It can, therefore, be no matter of surprise that the Brazilians should
have felt verv stranely the unfavonrahla nasitinn in which they were
thus placed in the disposal of their produce, and should have been ex-
ceedingly anxious to get rid of so partial a treaty as carly as possible ;
and this anxiety could be in no way lessened by seeing, in 1841, that
the great struggle between political parties in this country was
actually successfully tried on the issue of affirming the continuance
of this state of the law ; and that the proposition which led to this
decision of the legislature was introduced by the representative of a
great commercial town, second only to London, which had more to
lose or gain by the Brazilian trade than any other. But what was
still more-disheartening to them was, that when again appealed to
the electors of that great commercial town again returned Lord Sandon
as their advocate for restriction of trade. In their anxiety to termi-
nate this treaty they placed a construction on the words quoted above,
that they were at liberty to do so at the end of fifteen years by
giving a notice of two years previous to the expiry, thereof, which they
> = accordingly did in 1840, making the treaty to expire in 1842 ; our
Government, however, contended, and we have no doubt rightly so,
that the power of giving that notice did not arise till the expiry of
the fifteen years in 1842, which version was acted upon, and the due
notice having been repeated in 1842, this treaty accordingly expires
next year. These circumstances are chiefly of importance, as showing
how earnestly and severely the Brazilians feel their disadvantageous
position.

Now, then, what steps have we taken to protect and retain this im-
portant branch ot our trade? Last autumn Mr Ellis was sent out with
powers to negotiate a new treaty ; he, however, returned without any
success, and it has never transpired what were the proposals which he
was authorised to make ; it has, however, transpired that the Brazilian
Government required that their produce should be admitted to this
country at a duty not exceeding that charged on our colonial produce,
more than 10 per cent. ; that duty being now 24 per cwt. on sugar,
and 4d. a pound on coffee, would make, with the addition of 10 per cent.
in each case, the duty on Brazilian sugar and coffee about 110 per cent.,
while our goods are there subject only to a duty of 184 percent. Thus
the matter remains, as far as we are concerned, in statu quo. A long
session of parliament has just concluded, which has been marked in an
nnusual way, by the little that has been done, and during which time
this urgent and important question has scarcely been alluded to.
Whilt xe, however, are doing nothing, let us inquire what others

THE ECONOMIST. [September 2,
fore us a long report made by Francisco Vianna, the Finance Minister
to the Emperor, dated the 17th of May last, and also a decree of
the Emperor of the same date, by which he appoints a commission
“for the purpose of arranging a new tariff,’ &c. &c. from which we
extract the following :—
“ Art. 4. It will take the necessary steps to select those commodities which
Sorm the prime necessaries of life, or, from habit, have become the principal
articles of consumption, the produce of, and imported from, foreign states,
subjecting them to a duty of 20 per cent. ad valorem, with the exception,
however, of such as, without prejudice to the consumers amongst the
lower orders, and without risk of being smuggled, can be charged with a
higher rate of duty. Of these a separate list must be formed, and on which
a duty of 24 per cent. shall be charged, notwithstanding they may be con-
sidered articles of necessity.
“6. It must, likewise, ascertain what kinds of produce or merchandize
imported from other countries are identical with those produced in Brazil,
the latter being prejudiced by competition with the former ; on such a duty of
from 50 to 60 per cent. should be imposed, according to the quality of those
produced in the empire, the amount of capital employed in their produc-
tion, and the perfection of which they are susceptible.
“7. The commission will subject to the said rate of duties all such pro-
ducts and merchandize as are now beginning to be produced or manufac-
tured in the empire, or the manufacture of which can be readily introduced
from the abundance of the raw material indigenous now produced : gradu-
ating the scale of such duties according to the greater or less degree of
perfection they can be manufactured in this country (Brazil).
“8. Cotton manufactures of the coarsest quality shall be subjected to a
duty of 60 per cent., those of finer quality to 40 or 50.
“9, All looms and machinery employed in making yarn, or weaving
cloth, are to be exempted from all duties whatever.
“11. Wines and spirituous liquors are to pay 50 per cent., and all other
goods, wares, and merchandize not specially mentioned in this decree shall
pay 34 per cent.
“14, AND FINALLY, WILL TAKE ESPECIAL
AGAINST THE TERMINATION OF THE TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN, SUB-
MITTING THE RESULT OF ITS LABOUR TO ME, THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF
my SECRETARY OF STATE OF THE Finance DEPARTMENT.
CARE TO BE PREPARED
In these extracts we are forcibly struck with four important consi-
derations :—
First. That whatever duties the Brazilian Government impose, those
on the first necessaries of life shall be on the lowest scale.
Second. That they are about to place a prohibitory duty on most of
the articles which we export to that country.
Third. That they are ready to avail themselves of our new laws
allowing the export of machinery ; and
Fourth. That all their arrangements are directed to be “ prepared
against the termination of the treaty with Great Britain.”
In the meantime a Brazilian Princess has been united by marriage
with a French Prince; and rumours are afloat of a commercial
treaty being at this moment privately under discussion between these
two countries.
In Germany, also, where Brazilian produce is chiefly consumed at
very low duties, and where a strong desire becomes manifest to extend
their export trade ot manufactured goods, the hope of inducing the
Brazilian Government to conclude a treaty with them favourable to
their goods is daily becoming stronger. The following extract of a
letter in a Bremen paper, translated into the Leeds Mercury, accurately
expresses the very general feeling in Germany on this subject :—
“ There is scarcely any country in the world that possesses such a power
as Germany to procure a great sale of the products of its industry. This
power of Germany when united, as we hope it soon will be, consists exclu-
sively of the great use of colonial productions, No consideration towards
its own colonies, no political dependence on neighbouring states will tie up
its hands; it only requires the will of its distinguished statesmen, with the
assistance and advice of practical men of business from the sea-ports, to
call into life a commercial policy, founded on reciprocity after the model
of the United States of North America. Almost all those markets abroad
now supplied with the British manufactures in preponderating quantities,
and principally the Brazilian market, which is now almost exclusively
in the possession of British industry, would be constrained to make a
greater use of German manufactures, as soon as United Germany had the
courage to impose differential duties on the products of those countries,
which till now have only come to us in British and foreign ships, and almost
exclusively in return for British manufactures, till they are convinced of
the indispensability of the great German consuming markets, and see the
necessity of making reciprocal concessions.”
Concurrent with all these circumstances, a Brazilian Minister has
arrived among us for the purpose of re-opening a negotiation for a new
treaty. But strange to say, notwithstanding the heavy stakes which
hang on the result, his appearance creates as little interest or excite-
ment with the public, and for that reason only, with the Government,
as ifthe two countries had no connexion with each other. Let us
shortly examine what this connexion is, and whose interests are now
so deeply at stake. In 1840, the exports of British produce to the
Brazils consisted of—

tits enumeration in order to show how varied are the interests
in this country which are deeply involved in the result of this ques-
tion. By the new tariff proposed the largest portion of all this
trade will infallibly be lost ; and hereafter, when our manufacturing
districts are thrown into still deeper gloom and distress, WHEN FARMERS
ARE STILL MORE AND MORE DEPRESSED IN CONSEQUENCE OF DEFICIEN™

restriction and monopoly, we shall again »¢ (old,—-No ; it arises trom

We have, bhow“ver, only viewed this subject in relation to the just
complaiuts of the Brazils of the very unequal character of our trade 3
put if we had space we could easily show that whatever hey have sut-
fered from that cause, from being deprived of this market for the sal
of their produce, the people of this country have suffered infinitely more
by having been deprived of that which would have been to them a
source of the greatest blessing and comfort ; and that the conditions
insisted on by the Brazilians for a continuance of our trade—instead
of being onc rous to us, are among the acts which would, independently
of any other considerations, be of the greatest benefit to the country.
We have shown in our preliminary number that the supply of sugars
has not increased for the last twenty years, while the population has
increased at least six millions ; and what the Brazilians ask is, that we
should have larger supply at lower prices than we now pay.
It is, however, alarming to see the deeply culpable apathy, or
ignorance, or both, which prevails in the public mind on this
important question. Have the people in Liverpool not yet seen
enough of ruin amongst their neighbours, enough of domestic heart-
burnings and wailings, during the last four years, that they can now
look on unconcernedly and see another large branch of their trade
placed in the greatest hazard? Have the manufacturers in the
Potteries, in Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Manchester, Glasgow, and
elsewhere, become so heedless of their own interests, and those of the
millions of hard-working people around them, that they disregard the
loss of the fourth largest foreign market which they now possess ?
Have the large farmers and graziers in Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire,
Yorkshire, and Cheshire become so reconciled to their share of th«
ruin and depression in the manufacturing districts, that they are
prepared for a still further loss of demand, a still further sinking of
prices ? Where is Mr Christopher and their other

A long session has
been passed with all these facts before their eyes, without a single pro-
position on the subject ; and now the Brazilian Minister having arrived
in London, the Queen’s Ministers have departed to enjoy the lull of
the autumn in quiet and retirement, and it may, therefore, be that the
foreign Minister may find his time better occupied at the Courts of
Paris or Berlin.
No, if the country will make an effort—and it is infinitely more
worth an effort than most of the little, silly,
engross and excite the public mind
petty squabbles which
they must take the subject into
their own hands ; they must forego that blind reliance on the myste-
ries of Downing street and Whitehall ; and, by exercising the same
popular influence on the Ministry which on another occasion they
were able lately to do, they may yet succeed in averting this great
evil ;—but let no man blame the Ministers while he himself remains
heedless and supine in matters of this importance immediately and
deeply affecting himself; the question at issue to the British public
really being, whether we will accept cheap sugar, and retain, nay
improve, our means of paying for it, or whether we will persist in
paying an extravagant price, and be deprived, at the same time, of
much of the means we have at present to do so.

RENEWED COMMERCIAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH
PORTUGAL.
The Doxe or Parmetra is in this country—and we have good au-
thority for stating that he comes at the request of the Queen of Por-
tugal—not only with powers, but with very distinct instructions to
scttle the subjects of dispute in arranging the tariffs of the two coun-
tries. It appears that Oporto, a place at all times the peace of which
gives considerable concern to the court in Lisbon, has given hints
which the Queen and her Ministers do not think it wise to disregard.
It is therefore likely that the wine trade will for some time at least
be again exposed to that partial suspension and uncertainty, from
which it has already suffered so much, arising from that mischievous
practice of regulating our trade by the will and caprice of other coun-
tries instead of acting only on principles best suited te our own con-

COURT AND ARISTOCRACY.
THE ROYAL EXCURSION.
Last week, the sudden arrival and sudden departure of the sons of Louis
Philippe, the King of the French, created some speculation and uneasiness
in the public mind. It was conjectured that they must have received some
slight or intimation at Windsor, which caused their apparently abrupt leave ;
and the natural inference was, that if this were the case, it would embitter
the feeling between this country and France, and increase the chances
of war.
On Saturday morning, the public mind was relieved by the intelligence
that the visit of the French Princes to the Queen, though hasty, was far
from being unfriendly. The King of the French, on learning that the
Queen of Great Britain proposed to take a marine excursion, sent his sons
with a message to say, that if her Majesty would honour him with a visit at
his Chateau d’Eu, he would at once proceed to the coast in order to receive
her, and pay his respects. This report, from the character of Louis Phi-
lippe, was considered exceedingly probable ; and as it was understood that
her Majesty had accepted the invitation in the same frank and cordial
spirit in which it had been given, fear was turned into pleasure, and onthe
natal day of Prince Albert the metropolis and the Stock Exchance had the
satisfaction of knowing that the “dark clouds” which rumour of the pre-~
vious day had caused to “lower upon our house,” were “in the deep bosom
of the ocean buried.”
So Saturday last was the birthday of his Royal Highness Prinee Albert—
on that day he was twenty-four years of age. A very young man indeed,
to be already the parent stock of what promises to be at once a numerous
and a new Royal line. But young as he is, he has conducted himself with a
propriety and a judgment, in this his adopted country, which has rendered
him a universal favourite. Everybody likes Prince Albert—graceful,
accomplished, handsome, and kindly-hearted, he won golden opinions from:
all ranks and classes. The conduct of the Queen towards him is also such
as to conciliate the good will of all. By prerogative and law her Majesty
is hig “ lord and master,” but she ever conducts herself towards him as @
dutiful and affectionate wife, setting, thereby, an example of domestic
decorum to the humblest of her subjects. They are ee. a very
happy Royal couple, which has ever been too much of a rarity amongst
kings, princes, and other “ grit folk. ‘ Long may their felicity last !
Savuiday, we have caid, was the Prince’s twenty-fourth birthday; and
of course it was kept as a féte. Virpint- Wotor was selected as the scene;
there was a banquet in the Fishing ‘Temple, at Which uc. Majesty, Prince
Albert, the Duchess of Kent, and the Court circle, were present; the fem —
ple, the frigates on the lake, &c. were illuminated ; and the enjoyments of
the evening were concluded by a splendid display of fireworks, which
were witnessed by upwards of ten thousand persons, many of whom had
been attracted to the scene from the metropolis. wi ; os
On Sunday the Queen and Prince Albert attended divine service within
the Castle; and on Monday morning they left W indsor for their marine
excursion. ‘They proceeded to the Farnborough station (South-W estern
Railway), which is sixteen miles from Windsor, where the Royal railway
iage was in waiting.
tthe various stations on the line between Farnborough and Southampton
were decorated with flags and laurel, and the inhabitants of the adjacent
country and villages were assembled in great numbers to show their
loyalty, and gratify their curiosity. At Basingstoke, more particularly,
the assemblage of spectators was very numerous, and appropriate sentences
or mottoes were emblazoned on the railings by the road-side.
At the station at Winchester, the concourse of spectators lined one side
of the road for nearly half a mile. All of them expressed their loyalty
and gratification by loud cheers, and waving of handkerchiefs and hats.
Her Majesty and Prince Albert bowed repeatedly as the train passed at a
very rapid rate. ;
At twenty minutes to eleven o'clock, the train reached the terminus at
Southampton, where every preparation had been made to do honour to
the Royal visitors. Unfortunately the morning was not propitious for the
occasion. The rain was descending in drizzling showers of sleet, and the
wind was blowing cold and comfortless :, nevertheless, thousands of people
were assembled, both sides of the railroad were crowded, and the platform
at the terminus was covered. The Queen, on alighting, was received by
the Duke of Wellington and the Earls of Aberdeen and Liverpool. Her
Majesty was loudly cheered as she entered the Royal carriage, which was
drawn up close to the platform. The band struck up “ God save the
Queen,” and the cannons thundered forth a Royal salute, whilst from the
towers and steeples of the churches the bells rang out peal after peal of
welcome. Her Majesty looked remarkably well, and both she and Prince
Albert were in high spirits. They bowed repeatedly to the crowds of
spectators, who pressed as closely round the carriage as the police and the
guard of honour permitted them. The Queen was dressed in a claret-
coloured silk dress, over which she wore a Paisley shawl worked with
green; she had on a straw bonnet with green feathers and ribands,
Prince Albert was in a plain dark frock coat.
Passing through Sonthampton, which was literally “decorated” for
the occasion, the Royal carriages reached the pier at a quarter past eleven
o'clock, when her Majesty and the Prince embarked without delay on |
board the admiral’s barge, rowed by twelve seamen; the Royal yacht
lying at a short distance, not certainly above two or three boats’ lengths
from the land. j
were received by Lord Haddington and other Lords of the Admiralty,
Admiral Sir Charles Rowley, Lord Adolphus Fitzclarence, and the other
officers in command. Sir Hercules Pakenham was also in attendance.
Lords Aberdeen and Liverpool were on board the Royal yacht, and accom-
panied her Majesty and Prince Albert on this excursion. The Duke of
Wellington was on the pier, but did not go on board the yacht; his Grace
left for London at one o'clock by a special train, Immediately on her
Majesty ascending the deck of the Royal yacht, another Royal salute was
fired. “Her Majesty did not long remain on deck, the incessant rain com-
pelling her to retreat ly the vabiu,
The Royal party proceeded to Cowes, and afterwards made an excursion |
to Spithead, returning to Ryde, where they landed for a short time, dining |
and sleeping on board the Royal yacht; which, on Monday night, was |
]
anchored in Cowes Roads. Tuesday was devoted to an excursion to
Norris Castle, in the Isle of Wight, where her Majesty formerly resided
when Princess Victoria, and the remainder of the day to a sail round the
island. Wednesday was spent sailing along the coast, westwards, and at five
o'clock in the afternoon the Royal yacht arrived off Plymouth. The
firing of a gun from the citadel announced to the expectant thousands
the appearance of the Victoria and Albert, in the offing, and the salutes
which immediately followed, and the buzz of “ The Queen, the Queen,”
in all directions, produced a most animated and interesting scene. About
half-past five o'clock the Victoria and Albert entered the Sound by the |
eastern channel of the Breakwater, and having lessened the power of her
steam, proceeded across the Sound in the most majestic style, and was
saluted as she passed onward by the men-of-war lying at anchor, viz. :
Caledonia, 120 ; Formidable, 84; Apollo, troop ship ; the Neapolitan
frigate; the garrison ; a number of yachts and merchant vessels ; the crews
of the respective vessels, dressed in blue and white, manned the yards, |
and the scene altogether was very splendid and animating. ;
At eight o’clock on Thursday morning the Queen and her Royal Con-
sort left the yacht, and landed at Mount Edgecumbe, where they remained
for two hours, and returned on board. His Royal Highness Prince Albert
afterwards visited the Dockyard and the Victualling office. All the
authorities, naval and municipal, were active in paying their respects, and
showing due attention,
It is said that the Royal Visitors intend proceeding to Falmouth on
leaving Plymouth, and after to cross the Channel, to visit the King of the
French. We understand that the Lords of the Admiralty have given strict
orders that the commander of the expedition should on no account keep
at sea after it is dark, but put into the first port he can make before the
daylight departs.
On Monday morning the Duke of Wellington, the Earl of Liverpool,
and the Earl of Aberdeen, started from the Nine Elms station, Vauxhall,
in order to be with her Majesty at Southampton. The Duke is proverbially
punctual, and arrived at the station as early as half-past six. Five minutes
afterwards the Earl of Aberdeen arrived, and asked, with some apparent
anxiety, whether the gallant Duke had arrived, and on being informed that
he was at that time inspecting the train, jocularly remarked, in allusion,
doubtless, to his Grace’s proverbial punctuality, “ God bless my soul, I
thought I should have been before him this morning.”

EsPaRTERO, THE REGENT oF Sparn.—Since the arrival of this illustrious
exile in this country, he has resided at Mivart’s hotel, living retired and
secluded. He has, however, been honoured by the calls of many distin-

the Earl of Aur xdeen, ag Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, wrote to
the Regent, on Friday evening, to signify it was her Majesty’s pleasure
that his Highness would have an audiences with the Queen, at three o’clock
on Saturday afternoon, at Windsor Castle. In consequence, the Regent
left Mivart’s hotel, and proceeded by a special train to Slengh, and from
thence direct to the Castle. Colonel Gurrea, private secretary to the
Regent, alone accompanied his Highness. The Regent had every reason
to be highly gratified with the reception he met with from her Majesty
and Prince Albert. The interview of his Highness with the Queen and
Prince Albert lasted about half'an hour. On leaving Windsor the Regent
and Colonel Gurrea came direct to town, and reached Mivart’s at a quarter
past six o’clock. The Regent dined on Tuesday with Lord and Lady
Palmerston, with a select party.

THE METROPOLI
A Special Court of Common Council of the City of London was yester-
day held in the Commercial Room No. 1, at the Guildhall (the Council
Chamber being under repair), to consider the propriety of the Court ex-
o.
| pressing its sympathy with General Espartero, the Regent of Spain, and
its regret at the frustration of his plans for the benefit of his country.
The Court was convened in consequence of a requisition, which was most
numerously and respectably signed, having been presented to the Lord
Mayor by Mr Deputy Green and Mr Deputy Peacock.
The Lord Mayor took the chair at twelve o’clock.
The minutes of the proceedings of the last Court were read and con-
firmed, and some preliminary routine business having been transacted,
The Town Clerk read the requisition, and the order for convening the
Court, after which,
Mr Deputy Peacock, in a speech laudatory of the conduct of the Regent,
proposed the following resolution :—
“That this Court, feeling a deep interest in the independence and
prosperity of the Spanish people, intimately connected as they are with
the state of commercial and political intercourse which must tend to the
mutual advantage of both nations, has witnessed with disappointment and
sorrow the forced retirement of the Regent of Spain from that country,
which undor his zealous, disinterested, and patriotic guidance was making
rapid strides in the path of constitutiona: government. ‘That it desires to
express sincere sympathy with the Regent, and sorrow for the frustration
of his wise and philanthropic plans for the permanent happiness of Spain;
and its cordial wish that the triumph of corrupt intrigue and foreign anti-
national influence may be rendered of short duration, by his speedy recal
to the country he has served so faithfully, feeling assured that the
| happiness of the people, the only valuable end of good government, will
be thereby increased.
Mr Deputy Green seconded the resolution.
Sir Peter Laurie moved the previous question by way of amendment.
This was the second deliberative body in the kingdom, and they ought
not to commit themselves lightly to the policy of interference with the
internal concerns of other nations, as they would do if they consented to
this resolution. (Hear, hear.) They had no right to interfere in the in-
ternal arrangement of the Government of Spain. What should we think
if the Spanish nation were to attempt to interfere with us? This ques-
| tion must be considered politically, for after all it was a political question
After a somewhat animated debate, the amendment was negatived, and
any difficulty respecting the presentation of the address was removed by
the Lord Mayor, who invited the Common Council to an entertainment
at the Mansion House, at which it is presumed Espartero will be present.
CENTRAL CRIMINAL COURT.
On Friday week Lieutenant Cuddy was tried for his participation, as
second, in the recent fatal duel, in which Colonel Fawcett lost his life.
The indictment against Mr Gulliver, the surgeon, was abandoned, and he
was admitted as a witness, The jury felt the dilemma in which they
were placed, between the penalties of the law and those sanctions of
public opinion by which, even to this day, duelling is tacitly recognised
as a virtue of fashionable life. They at last found a verdict ot Not
Guilty, on the ground that no legal evidence had been given to justify a
conviction for guilty participation. The metropolitan press, and a portion
of the provincial, has, in consequence, been preaching about duelling,
and how it can be eradicated. A little more of the true spirit of Chris-
tianity might be worth a trial.
A wretch called Hamilton was tried for writing letters to a respectable
family of the name of Hopper, threatening to expose the daughters as
guilty of infamous conduct, unless he was bribed to silence with money.
The young ladies were naturally dreadfully agitated by the persevering
conduct of the scoundrel, but they had the courage to get him appre-
hended and committed for trial; and on Saturday last the jury convicted
him, and the judge, Baron Rolfe, sentenced him to fourteen years’ trans-
portation.
On Saturday, Leopold Meyer, aged 20, traveller, and Robert Berg
aged 21, interpreter, were placed at the bar, Meyer charged with
stealing a diamond ring, value 201. the property “of Philip George
Dodd, in his dwelling-house, and Berg with feloniously receiving the
same, well knowing it to have been stolen.—The jury returned a verdict
of Gyilty,—Berg requested to be allowed once more to speak for himyelf,
or, as he expressed himself, “ My lord, I beg of you to allow me one last
free vote.” He then proceeded to denounce Inspector Pearse as a per-
jurer and suborner of perjury, and said that he (Berg) and many more
after him would stand at the bar and have their liberties sworn away and
all their prosperity and hopes blasted by similar practices, but God would
not be always silent. He would at length speak and vindicate the inno-
cent. After going on in this strain for some time, he said he appealed to
the gentlemen of the public press to do him justice, and let the world
know that he owed his present misfortunes to Inspector Pearse.—He was
then sentenced to seven years’ transportation, and Meyer to six months’
imprisonment with hard labour.
Samuel Wand, aged 38, baker, was indicted for forging a deed of assign-
ment, &c., with intent to defraud James Christian Clement Bell and
others. It appeared that a deceased relative of the prisoner, a Mrs Wand,
had left a large property to be divided amongst seventeen persons, one of
whom was the prisoner, whose share amounted to about 301. a year. This
he disposed of some years since, and the present charge was brought
against him in consequence of his having negotiated a sale of his cousin’s
share, whose name he forged. The fraud was practised on the London
Reversionary Interest Society, who purchased the reversion (503%. 10s.).
Mr Bell and others were trustees of the society.—The jury returned a
verdict of Guilty.—Mr Justice Williams addressed the prisoner, and sen-
tenced him to ten years’ transportation.
On Monday, Samuel Sydney Smith, aged 32, agent, was indicted for
feloniously forging and uttering a bill of exchange for 150/. with intent to
defraud Lyon Samuels, a silversmith and jeweller, residing in Bury street,
St Mary Axe. On the 9th of March last the prisoner called upon him,
and presented the bill in question for discount. He described it as the
bill of Henry Bush and Co., highly respectable merchants, of Baldwin
street, in the city of Bristol, one of the partners being a member of the
town council. He said he was sent to witness by Messrs Ford and Savage,
solicitors, of Henrietta street, Covent garden. Witness, knowing that
firm to be highly respectable, desired the prisoner to leave the bill, in
order that he might make inquiries respecting it. Instead of doing so,
the prisoner proposed to take witness to Messrs Ford and Savage at once.
Witness assented, and they both got into a cab and drove to Henrietta
street, when they were informed that Messrs Ford and Savage were from
home. The prisoner then volunteered to bring a letter from the firm,
which witness said would answer; and in the course of the evening he
(witness) received a letter from his clerk, Mr Ellis, which purported to
be from Mr Savage. On the following day the prisoner called again, and
asked if witness had received the letter. Witness said his clerk had read
it to him, as witness could not himself read English. The letter recom-
mended the prisoner as an honest respectable man, and upon the faith of
the letter witness discounted the bill, giving the prisoner a check for 100/.
on account. Next day witness gave him another check for 40/. and the
remaining 10/. was to be settled when the bill was paid, which never hap-
pened, for it was dishonoured.—The witness was severely cross-examined by
Mr Ballantine, with a view to show that he wasa regular bill discounter.—
A witness, calling himself Henry Bush, was adduced on behalf of the
prisoner, with the view of proving that he was the true and genuine Bush
who drew the bill, and on whose credit it was discounted. He, however,
broke completely down in his evidence, and proved to the satisfaction of
the jury that whatever credit he had was anything but creditable, and
the judge directed that he should be committed for trial at the next ses-
sions for his share in the forgery. Smith was therefore found guilty, and
sentenced to be transported for life. ;
There were various other trials, for various other of the routine crimes
which are brought under investigation at every session and assize. Of
these we do not think it necessary to preserve a record.
Merropouitan Pornice Courtrs.—Including the Mansion House and
Guildhall, there are thirteen metropolitan police courts, which serve as

An inquiry was gone into at the Sheriff's Court before a jury, to
ascertain whether certain goods were the property of Mr Deane, the
alleged Crown debtor, or of Mr Threlkeld, who had advanced a loan of
1,5001. to Mr Deane. The jury returned a verdict for the claimant.
On Friday morning, shortly before one o'clock, a fire, which was not
extinguished until property to the amount of some thousands of pounds
was consumed, broke out in the spacious premises belonging to Messrs
Staines, well known as the Stingo Brewery, situate in the New road,
Paddington. ‘The premises in question were bounded on one side by the
Queen’s Lying-in Hospital, on the other by the Yorkshire Stingo
Tavern.

Derspy, Ava. 26.—Considerable sensation was caused here to-day, by
a voluntary discovery, on the part of the individual self-implicated, named
Joseph Growcock, about seventeen years of age, of an attempt to com-
mit murder. He had kept a school at Leicester about nine months, at the
expiration of which period he suddenly decamped, in consequence of a
charge henging over him of having stolen some books. He states that
during his stay in Nottingham, lie was “frequently haunted with a fiendish
desire to murder somebody ag
‘ and that he made several attempts to decoy
children into secluded spots, for the purpose of gratifying this extraor-
dinary propensity. Having given a circumstantial account of his having
decoyed away a young girl, who, when lying asleep in a secluded Jane, he
beat about the head with a hammer, and left for dead, police officers

John Hulme, alias “ Cast-metal Jack,” was indicted for the wilful
murder of Thomas Garland, on the road between Ashton and Manchester,
on the 3lst of October, 1840. The circumstances of the murder are still
fresh in the recollection of most readers. There had been a turn-out of
sawyers, and Garland and three others, who were working there as knob-
sticks, were returning to Manchester (it being Saturday evening), when
about half a mile from the new church, four men rushed from behind a
cart going the opposite way, and which had concealed them, and attacked
Garland and the others with bludgeons and rods of iron. Garland re-
ceived a cut of the thumb, was afterwards made an out-patient of the
infirmary, but the wound mortified, produced lock-jaw, and death ensued.
—Evidence affecting the prisoner did not come out that he was one of the
men till subsequent to a second murder by the turn-outs, when he had
gone to America. He returned from America only a few months since.
—The jury, after an absence of ten minutes only, returned a verdict of
Manslaughter.—His Lordship, addressing the prisoner, said: The jury
had acquitted him of murder, but had found him guilty of manslaughter
under very aggravated circumstances, which morally as well as legally
left his offence but one step short of murder. The injury he had done
was not the result of sudden heat of blood or quarrel, but of a deliberate
determination to commit violence, for the purpose of preventing others
working for the wages they chose to work for. Every man in England
had a right to work for whom he would, and any attempt to prevent it
was not only illegal, but ‘an attempt to exercise an odious tyranny,
utterly intolerable in a free country like this. The safety of society
requires that an example be made in your case, and the sentence of the
court is, that you be transported for the term of your natural life.
DREADFUL MURDER.
Since Tuesday morning the beautiful seat of the Earl of Darnley, at
Cobham park, near Gravesend, in Kent, its village, and the surrounding
suburbs, have been the scene of much excitement in consequence of the
perpetration of a murder, attended with circumstances of a truly dis-
tressing character. The victim Mr Dadd, sen., 55 years of age, @
person who a few years ago carried on a most extensive business at
Rochester, as a chemist and druggist. He had lately, however, retired, and
had gone to London, where he has since resided, in Suffolk street, Pall-
mall East, and gained some notoriety by the manufacture of an improved
oil for artists. He was found lying by the roadside, with his throat cut,
and a knifo not far from hie hady It has sinee been ascertained, beyond
a doubt, that the murderer of the unfortunate gentleman is no other than
is
his third son, Richard Dadd, a fine young man, 24 years age, and that he
committed the act whilst labouring under an aberration of intellect. He
was an artist of some celebrity, and has gained several prizes at the Royal
Acaaemy. A year or two ago this unfortunate youth accompanied Sir
Thomas Phillips, the late Mayor of Newport, on a tour through Italy,
Switzerland, Germany, &c., for the purpose of improving himself in
his art. Owing to his arduous studies and constant exposure to the sun,
his brain became affected to such a melancholy extent as to produce
insanity. The circumstances attending the dreadful deed have not yet
been correctly ascertained, nor has the youth been apprehended. ;

to propose a resolution which needed no recommendation from him, and
which only required to be read to ensure its adoption. It was:—
“That the Anti-Corn-law League, by their energetic and unwearicd
exertions in proving to the community generally, and especially to the
agriculturists, the evils of the so-called protective system, have well earned
the gratitude of their countrymen; and this meeting testify their high
gratification in being honoured by the presence of John Bright, Esq., &
distinguished member of that body, and, thanking him most earnestly for
his past exertions, rejoice that his sphere of usefulness is enlarg: d by his
triumphant election of the city of Durham.”
That was the resolution he had to propose, and all he begged was, that
they would reflect a little upon it. Just let them consider what effect the
election of John Bright for the city of Durham must necessarily have upon
the community at large,—on the great change which had taken place in
that city,—a change which was rapidly spreading throughout the country,
a change which would soon place the representatives of the people in the
House of Commons in the position from which they ought never to haye
been removed. (Loud cheers.)
Christopher Rawdon, Esq., most sincerely wished that he could add any-
thing in the way of novelty or strength to the arguments adduced in fayour
of the cause which they were assembled to support, but as he could not do
so, he would content himself with most cordially seconding the resolution.
The Chairman then put the resolution, and declared it to be carried
unanimously. A gentleman near the chair having said he thought he saw
one hand held up against it, the Chairman put the question again, but
the imaginary solitary dissentient did not appear in all the immense
assemblage.
John Bright, Esq., M.P., then rose, and his reception was most enthu-
siastic. When the repeated rounds of cheering had subsided, he ad-
dressed the audience in his able and eloquent style, dwelling with great
point on topics similar to those urged in the Preliminary Number of
Tue Economist, touching on coffee, wool, &c., and then
addressed himself to the question ot the opinions of the Liverpool
constituency. He knew that the 10/. householders of Liverpool were
in favour of free trade. (Hear, hear.) He would not make a speech
on party politics—he would not say a
sugar,
word of any the
representative of any constituency whatever, on any ground whatever,
against free trade. The 10/. householders of Liver-
pool declare in favour of free trade if an election took
morrow morning. (Great cheering.) But their borough had been handed
over, bound hand and foot, to the monopolists, by that portion of the
electors who were themselves the greatest sufferers by this system—men
who first crushed by it, and who would be plunged into the
intensest suffering unless this system were abolished. (Hear, hear.) He
had a right to speak to freemen. He was almost going to say that he had
no claim to sit in Parliament, except as the representative of the freemen
and working classes of the city of Durham. (Great cheering.) He had
canvassed them over and over, and over again. They had always been
asked to vote for either red or for blue, he believed that was the other
colour,—they had always voted for either Whig or Tory without thinking
that it was of any sort of consequence to them what sort of opinions were
held by the one or the other. But he had sat with them in their cottages ;
he saw them taking their breakfast and their tea; he showed them how
monopoly robbed them of their coffee and sugar, and of bread and butter for

their exulting river, he saw in it a source of great and increasing pros-
perity. A friend of his left this river on the 4th of this month, and in
twenty-five days be had a letter from him from Halifax, Nova Scotia ; in
six hours they cou'd travel from London to Boulogne ; and was it to be

as to worship monkeys: why the people of Liverpool bore some resem~
blance to the people of Egypt in that. (Much laughter and cheering.)
If he were an inhabitant of Liverpool he should be ashamed to acknow-

Liverpool did something as absurd as the worshipping of monkeys. ‘I hey

(Great cheering.) He asked them on behalf of the people of Rochdale,
who sent their produce through the port of Liverpool, who imported their
cotton and their wool through the port of Liverpool,—he asked them, on
behalf of that industrious population, amongst whom he lived, to vote for
the abolition of the corn laws; and on behalf of that constituency who
had entrusted him with the representation of their city, because he came
fearlessly amongst them to advocate the abolition of all monopolies, on
their behalf, and on behalf of the suffering people of this country, and on
behalf of the great principles of justice and humanity all the world over,
and on behalf of that Christianity for which they professed to be willing
to make some sacrifices,—he called upon them to think on this question,
and having thought upon it to decide, and give their voices and their
votes in favour of the abrogation of the worst law that any human legisla-
ture ever passed to the misery and misfortune of any people.—The Hon.
Gentleman resumed his seat amidst enthusiastic and prolonged acclama-
tions, having spoken exactly an hour and twenty minutes.
The Chairman said, that after what they had heard, and they had heard
a great deal, the next thing was to go and remember what they had heard,
and act upon it. The meeting was now dissolved, and he felt proud in
seeing such an assembly as the one before him that evening; one so well
conducted, and free from any of that clap-trap by which they had been so
often allured. He trusted they would remember what they had heard
and act upon it.
A vote of thanks to the Chairman was then moved by Mr Charles
Edward Rawlins, jun., which was put to the meeting and carried.
The Chairman briefly returned thanks for the honour conferred upon
him, and hoped that the people of Liverpool would show, not only in
word, but in deed, that which would tell on the next generation and on
children yet unborn.
Three cheers having been given for Mr Cobden, and the same for Mr
Bright, the meeting separated at a quarter to ten o’clock.
Anti-Monoroty Meetirnac at NewTon-IN-THE-WiLLows.--A large
meeting, attended by about 300 persons, many of them farmers, was held
in the village of Newton-in-the- Willows, on Tuesday evening last, the
Rev. Mr Massie in the chair. Mr C. E. Rawlins, jun., addressed the
meeting on behalf of the objects of the Anti-Monopoly Association. A
free-trade resolution was carried unanimously.
Free-Trave Festivan at Bury.—A great Free-Trade Festival was
held at Bury, on Thursday, in a pavilion erected for the purpose in
Paradise street, in honour of Mr Bright’s return for Durham. It was one
of the largest meetings of the kind ever held in Bury, upwards of one
thousand persons being present. Richard Walker, Esy., M.P., took the
chair, and on his right was John Bright, Esq., M.P., and on his left Jos.
Brotherton, Esq., M.P. Among the other gentlemen present were Alder-
man Brooks, Mr. R. R. Moore, the Rev. J. W. Massie, the Rev. Franklin
Howorth, and many of the leading merchants and manufacturers of Bury.
MOVEMENTS OF THE ANTI-CORN-LAW LEAGUE
The Anti-Bread- Tax Circular, the well-known organ of the Anti-Corn-
law League, gives the following summary view of the movements of
THE LEAGUE AMONGST THE FARMERS.
The county meetings having been suspended during the harvest, we
have no fresh rural triumph for our present number; but it may not be
amiss to take a retrospective glance at the progress of our agitation in
the agricultural districts during the late session of parliament. The time
is doubly appropriate for such a review, inasmuch as the labours of the
League, and the toils of the session, have been prorogued together.
Deputations from the League have visited eighteen counties, in which
twenty-two meetings have been held. We subjoin a list:
Counties Place of Meeting.

_ The course pursued in calling these meetings has, we believe, been
invariably the same, From a fortnight to three weeks’ notice has been
given throughout the county, by advertisement in the local papers, by
placards posted in all the towns and villages within twenty miles of the
place of meeting, and by handbills distributed to the farmers visiting the
principal markets. Hustings have been erected in the most convenient
public place sufficiently spacious to accommodate all who desired to take
a part in the proceedings, and the most influential landowner present has
been always preferred for chairman. With a view to giving the widest
and most correct publicity to the proceedings, able r po ters
, who have
have invaria-
bly accompanied the deputation from London taken down the
speeches verbatim, which have en printed and systematically distributed
by the agents of the League throughout every parish in the county.
Newport, Isuz or Wrantr.—The members for this borough and island
have this week received perhaps the most significant notice to quit which
has yet been given them, On Saturday evening one of the most numerous
meetings we have had in this district assembled in the Council Chamber
to hear an address from Mr Siducy Smith, on the subject of the Cora
Laws. We observed many of the most respectable inhabitants of the
borough present, and that they had brought their wives and daughters
with them. On the motion of Mr Dunkin, John Cooke was unanimously
called to the chair.—Mr Cooke stated, that although the choice of the
meeting might have fallen upon an abler chairman, it could not have
selected one more convinced of the necessity of regenerating the country
by emancipating its industry from the shac kles which were bringing it to
decay. (Hear.) To the National Anti-Corn-law League (cheers) the
country was indebted for the most patriotic exertions, and the most
untiring assiduity. (Cheers.) One of its oldest representatives, and ablest
speakers, was now before them, and he would no longer interpose between
them and the instructive address which he was confident they would
hear. (Cheers.)—Mr Sidney Smith on rising was welcomed with applause,
and delivered an address of two hours and a half. Some interruption was
anticipated from the Chartists, but if any “came to scoff,” they re mained
to praise. The speaker had every reason to congratulate himselt upon
the most favourable reception.—The Reverend Edmund Kell stated, that
the course of political instruction which the Anti-Corn-law League
afforded to the nation, was fraught with the most precious results, and
entitled that noble body to the most strenuous and universal support.
(Loud cheers.) Much valuable truth had been imparted to them by
their esteemed friend Mr Smith (hear, hear), and he now rose to propose
to him a vote of thanks, which was carried with loud cheers.—The Chair-
man, in putting the motion, said, that Mr Smith’s address had convinced
him that the Anti-Corn-law League were instructing the community,
not merely on a branch of political economy, but on the entire elements
of wise legislation. (Hear, hear.) They had that night heard Christianity
beautifully applied to the great business of public life (cheers), and
practical law making measured by the standard of truth and justice. The
motion was unanimously carried, and three cheers for the League.
ALREsSFoRD.—On Monday evening Mr Sidney Smith visited this lo-
cality. His address was announced to be delivered at the Market-room
of the Bell Inn, on the evils of the Corn Laws. The room was crowded
long before the time appointed for the de livery of the lecture, and the
clamouring for admission by those who were not so fortunate as to succeed
in getting in, became so great, that it became necessary to adjourn into
the street, where the meeting was addressed by Mr Smith, who took hig
place at the window of the Bell Inn, Many respectable townsmen and
ladies stood in the streets to hear the learned gentleman’s address, thus
manifesting the interest felt by them in the question,
AGRICULTURE.


all ears equally large: this, besides a heavy crop, produces an equal sam-
ple, which is more valuable in the market. The practice of dibbling the
wheat, which is found so useful in Norfolk and Suffolk, leaves proper
intervals between the plants, which can be hoed; and depositing the seed
at a proper depth insures the formation of roots beyond the influence of
a hot and dry sun. The great fault of the dibblers is, that they put too
many seeds in each dibble hole: if the seed is good, three or four grains,
at most, are sufficient; of these one or two only will take the lead, and
form the tuft; the others will be overpowered by the more vigorous.
When land is well prepared, half a bushel of seed is an ample allowance
for an acre; the rows being at nine inches from each other, and the dibble

POSTSCRIPT.
LONDON, Saturday Morning, September 2, 1843.
Stock ExcuAncE, TWELVE 0’cLocK.
There is little change to-dayin our markets, and no new feature in foreign
or English stocks, except that Consols are nominally a trifle higher, being
95 to 954, having left off yesterday at 94% to 95.
The last intelligence respecting the movements of her Majesty, left her
and her Royal consort visiting Weymouth, Plymouth, and Fs almouth. The
Royal yatht is probably to-day, Saturday, crossing the channel, her Majesty
being expected to arrive at the Chateau d’Eu on this evening, or on Sun-
day. The correspondent of the Morning Chronicle describes the C hateau
d’Eu situated on the river Bresle, close to, or rather within, the small
but very ancient town of Eu, and on the borders of Normandy. It is at the
distance inland of twomilesfrom the small fishing village of Treport, a place,
the very existence of which may be unknown to many of our countrymen,
who consider themselves by no means badly informed on most subjects.
But this obscure place is to acquire such a notoriety by the casual visit of
a Queen of England, as will make it for ages to come as familiar to every
Englishman as household words. The Chateau d’Eu, in its appearance,
certainly comes within the nomenclature of “fantastic,” for it has high
roofs, pinnacles, enormous chimneys, and other excrescences, which do not
accord with the architecture of modern palaces, but which still are not
without beauty and pleasing effect. The building itself is of considerable
extent, and its principal front handsome and imposing. In approaching it
from Abbeville, as I did, every one must be struck with admiration, both
of the beauty of the structure and its charming situation, surrounded as it
is with woods and green fields, and in the immediate neighbourhood of the
| picturesque town of Eu, and the tranquil river below.
The notice just issued by the Bank of England, with the settled appear-
ance of fine weather, lead to the conclusion that the present abundance of
money will continue. The Bank of England has given notice that loans
will be given as formerly on bills having not more than six months to run,
| on Exchequer-bills, and East India Bonds, to be repaid with interest at
the rate of three per cent., against the 19th of October next, for sums not
than 2,000/. each. Besides this low rate of usage for loans, more
capital is said to be in the market for investment on account of the pay-
ment of the opium claims, which amount to about 1,200,000/., and in a few
weeks hence the October dividends will come in course of payment, still
increasing the glut of money, and tending to keep the rates of interest
very low. In the midst of all this plethora of money in London, poverty
and distress form the general complaint from the provinces, and while
money is to be obtained by persons in good credit, at rates not exceeding
two per cent., there is a class of economists, who prescribe an issue of
paper as the remedy for the difficulties of the country.
The Marquis of Londonde rry’s letter to the Earl of Roden has had the
desired effect of inducing an abandonment of the intended Protestant
Anti-Repeal Demonstration at Belfast.

The Leeds Mercury of this morning inse erts an extract from the letter of
a London corre sponde nt in the following terms :—*“ London, 30th August,
1843.—We have it from first-rate authority that the Duke of Palmella
has come to this country without any powers to negotiate a treaty as
unwisely reported.” Our correspondent speaks of P aime lla as “a deep
diplomatist and intriguer, who is only beating the bush.” As, in another
part of the Economist, we have made a different statement, our esteemed
contemporary must excuse us for being disposed to rely on our authority
rather than that of its metropolitan correspondent, who, we believe, has
been misinformed.
The extensive sales of cotton at Liverpool excite much attention here,
as indicating either a very decided improvement in trade or reviving spe-
culation.
The average price of Wheat was such on Thursday as to reduce the
duty to 14s. per quarter. It seems probable that the duty will continue
the same for at least a fortnight, as it is not likely that the next weekly
average will be below the average of the week, which will be then struck
off in making the six weeks’ average.
Liverroot, Frrmay Nicut.—Cotton: the demand “seems to increase
rather than abate; the sales have been during the week, 63,130 bags,
making an aggregate, in three weeks, of 158,930 bags; 27,800 American,
and 2,000 Madras have been taken on speculation, and 1,450 American,
400 Peonams, and 300 Surat, for export this week.

1843.]
Cuance or Times, &c.—Among the hills the owners of woolly stock
complain that lambs, dinmonts, and gimmers are falling in price at a period
when rents are higher than ever; while such as fold the bleaters on tur-
nips shake their heads and say—* that breeding’s a surer trade than feed-
ing, as the best of us chance to en to our cost.” All the world are aware
of the marked difference between buying and selling, or, in other words,
the antagonist forces self-interest introduces into every market; and, in
conversing the other day with a clergyman on these and other matters, he
related the following anecdote of his uncle, one of the old stock of Ettrick
Forest :—About sixty years ago a worthy man, whose orbears for genera-
tions had rented lands under the bold Buccleuch, drove his lambs to St
Boswell’s fair, or, as it was then called, “ Boswell’s on the green.” Buyers
were not wanting, but even then, as now, they universally liked lucky
bargains; and the highest price offered to one of the acquaintances of
Dandie Dinmont for the castings of his carefully tended ewes was two-and-
twenty pence per head. This he considered an “ unco wee price ;” and,
although the lambs had travelled a distance of twenty miles, he determined
on re-driving rather than take it--a wearisome march and counter-march
for tiny trotters, less accustomed to hard roads than the velvet sward of a
green hill-side. After an interval allowed for rest and refreshment, he
pext turned his attention to the Langholm July fair; but, ou reaching that
lovely locality found, as often encugh happens, that he had realised the
proverb by “travelling farther and faring worse.” But, as expenses were
accumulating, there was no remead, and, accordingly, he struck a bargain
at five groats per lamb, gifting an odd one to every twenty, or as shepherds
say, making delivery by the clad score.—Dumfries Courier.
Britisu AssociATiIoN FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF Scrence.—On the
termination of the proceedings at Cork, it was resolved, that the next
meeting should be held in September, 1844, at York. The following
noblemen and gentlemen were appointed honorary officers of the Asso-
ciation for 1844:—President, The Very Rev. George Peacock, D.D., Dean
of Ely.— Vice-Presidents, Earl Fitzwilliam, F.R.S.; Lord Morpeth; John
Stuart Wortley, Esq., M.P.; Sir David Brewster, F.R.S. ; Michael Fara-
day, Esq., LL.D.; and the Hon. and Rev. W. V. Harcourt, F.R.S.—Locual

F.R.S. Amongst the council for 1844 are two of our townsmen, James
Heywood, Esq., F.R.S., F.G.S.; and Eaton Hodgkinson, Esq., F.R.S.
WHAT MAY BE DONE BY INDUSTRY, ACTIVITY, AND INTELLIGENCE.—
Mr Charles Bianconi, a gentleman exceedingly well known in Ireland, is
an Italian by birth, and was originally a travelling hawker. Having saved
a little money, and feeling, in the course of his travels, the want of means
of conveyance in the south of Ireland, he started a humble vehicle, and
ultimately succeeded in establishing a vast concern, as creditable to him-
self as beneficial to his adopted country. Personally he is an exceedingly
amiable and affable man. At the recent meeting at Cork of the British
Association he read a paper relative to his extensive coach and car establish-
ments, of which the following contains the most curious facts :—* In July,
1815, I started a car for the conveyance of passengers from Clonmel to
Cahir, which I subsequently extended to Tipperary and Limerick; at the
end of the same year I started similar cars from Clonmel to Cashel and
Thurless, and from Clonmel to Carrick and Waterford, and I have since
extended this establishment, including the most isolated localities, namely,
from Longford to Ballina and Belmullet, which is 201 miles north-west of
Dublin; from Athlone to Galway and Clifden, 183 miles due west of Dub-
lin; from Limerick to Tralee and Cahirciveen, 233 miles south-west of
Dublin, and numbering 110 vehicles; including mail coaches and different
sized cars, capable of carrying from four to twenty passengers each, and
travelling eight or nine miles an hour, at an average fare of one penny
farthing per mile for each passenger, and performing daily 3,800 miles,
passing through over 140 stations for the change of horses, consuming
3,000 to 4,000 tons of hay, and from 30,000 to 40,000 barrels of oats annually,
all of which are purchased in their respective localities. There were 1 40
stations, and each station had from one groom to six, or even eight; there
were somewhere about 110 drivers, and the horses were about 1,300. The
rate of travelling was from about eight to nine miles an hour, including
stoppages,
2 RI RR NI
THE WORLD IN MINIATURE.
Truc or false, there is a sublimity in the speculations of geologists
which fascinates the imagination. They tell us of successive forma-
tions of the crust of the earth; of long periods, during which repeated,
renewed, and wholly different races of creatures basked in the sun-
shine, or preyed in the waters; and of successive revolutions subverting
all that had pre-existed, and all leading, through a sort of eternity in
time, to the grand result of the world as it now is, inhabited by the
human race.
[t may be very fanciful: but the moral and social progress of the
human race seems to bear some resemblance to these geological specu-
lations. For there are those amongst us, who, amid doubt, discourage-
ment, decayed enthusiasm, and even chilling sneer, still cling to the
belief, that a better, a higher, a nobler destiny still awaits the family
of man. Not an imaginary perfectibility, not a visionary millennium,
not such a change of the organic structure, body and mind, as would
make the human being other than he is. But man as he is, in many
respects helpless, in much imperfect, and in all feeble, when viewed
individually, is still capable of a social elevation such as society has not
yet beheld. Christianity is to be the prime agent of the change. Its
divine truths, thoroughly pervading th atmosphere of public opinion;
working upon all thought, updn all mind, upon all education; calling
to their aid the wondrous resources of science, and all the appliances
of art; gradually, from generation to gencration, elevating the common
standard of morals and of knowledge; and achieving the prime result
of making NUMAN Law subservient to the prime object of ministering
to the best interests of humanity:
/ these are capable—perfectly capabl

that the world moves. They can witness the volcanic eruption of
French revolution without the absorbing fear, that the “ boiling lava”
is destined to encrust the globe, and embrace religion, honour, truth
and social order in one petrifying deluge ; nay, the world may rise in
arms, and though deprecating the misery and the mischief which the
folly and the passion of man inflicts upon his kind, still they feel that
“all things work together for good.” The world does move; that is
their conviction, and it is ours; were it not so, the Economist should
not have appeared.
All great changes have been preceded by a general conviction of a
WANT—a something which all concurred in testifying they felt to be
essential. The introduction of Christianity itself was preceded by a
general decay of Pagan superstition, which, even before the birth of
Our Saviour, was losing its hold over all educated and intelligent
minds. Nay, the Hebrew polity was already waxing old, and prepar-
ing to vanish away, at the period of the Advent. And when the
Apostles set forth on their great mission, the way was cleared before
them; the Roman empire comprised what was considered as the known
world; and though troubles prevailed here and there, the universal
peace was but little broken. Similar concurring causes may be re-
marked as coincident with other great changes in the moral and social
condition of the human race; old errors decaying; new truths dawning
on the horizon; commotion, controversy, and even revolution ensuing;
and at last the new condition of humanity becoming as much an essen-
tial of the race, as if we had lived under it since Adam was created.
Now, everything around us concurs to demonstrate that we are
approaching 1, GREAT CHANGE, not only in pent-up Britain, but all over
the earth. The social! problem of this age is the rapid MULTIPLICATION
THE HUMAN RACE. ‘The great question is, by what means may
this increase be met, by a corresponding increase of MATERIAL ENJOY-
OF
MENT. Since the world began, no such phenomenon has met the eye
of the observer. Particular countries may have risen, flourished, and
faded; particular nations at particular periods may have swollen out
into multitudinous combinations, afterwards leaving but a relic of
themselves; and at this very day and hour particular races are unhap-
pily disappearing from the earth. Yet it stands as the one vast and
stupendous ract of the present day, that within the now capacious
bounds of what is called civilization, the human race is multiplifying
at a rate unknown since man appeared on the globe. ‘This is the fact
which perplexes governments and amazes nations; which calls into
existence hostile tariffs and perpetuates commercial blunders; which
leads senates into the vain delusion that there is a shorter road to the
WEALTH OF NATIONS than that which nature and providence point out;
and which has created a war of social interests more momentous in its
consequences than all the conquests of an Alexander, all the achieve-
ments of a Napoleon, all the victories of a Marlborough or a Wellington.
Man multiplies within all the range of civilization, and is casting his
swarms beyond it; man multiplies, not alone within Great Britain,
where they say some 230,000 souls are annually added to our numbers,
but in France, in Germany, in the United States, in Southern America,
in India, in the South Seas. Turn back upon the by-past records of
history, and ask if such a phenomenon was ever known before. No!
the swelling flood of human life rises up to the topmost height of all-its
ancient barriers—way must be found for it, or it will overleap them all!
Yes !—the world is on the eve of a stupendous social change. The
old delusions of seclusion, exclusion, restriction, interference, and pro-
tection are waxing old, and are even now ready to vanish away. No
man believes in their permanence, who has a heart to feel, and a mind
to think; and if events are in any way the interpretation and the index
of Providence, we may with reverence affirm, that the finger of Gop
himself points man onwards. Through much suffering, it is said, is
the kingdom of heaven attained; through much suffering, it may also
be observed, do nations as well as individuals learn those truths which
are necessary to their temporal welfare. But at last, purged of their
dross, they appear in native lustre; and a whole people, taught by bitter
experience, receives them with humility, and applies them in earnest-
ness and faith.
It must also be recollected, that there are certain periods or times
in the application of truths, which are essential in their subservience
to man’s use. Christianity, for instance, to recur to our primary illus-
tration, was not promulgated until the ‘‘ fulness of time;’’ and some
of the greatest of those inventions which have blessed the human race
have been, as it were, purposely retarded until the world had been pre-
pared it. Amongst other examples, that of Printing may be
adduced, which was all but discovered two thousand years ago.

We hear of costly wines, but
the Emperor’s yearly draught of water:—
“The Northern winter imprisons the lovely nymph of the Neva in icy
bands for six months in the year. It is seldom till after the beginning of
April that the water requires sufficient warmth to burst her prison. At
that moment the commandant of the fortress, arrayed in all the insignia
of his rank, and accompanied by the officers of his suite, embarks in an
elegant gondola and repairs to the Emperor’s palace, which is immediately
opposite. He fills a large crystal goblet with the water of the Neva, and
presents it to the Empe ror, who drinks it off to the health of the dear
citizens of his capital. There is not, probably, on the face of the globe
another glass of water that brings a better price, for it is customary for
the Emperor to fill the goblet with ducats before he returfs it to the com-
mandant. Such, at least, was the custom; but the goblet was found to
have a sad tendency to enlarge its dimensions, so that the Emperor began
to perceive that he had every year a larger dose of water to drink, and a
greater number of ducats to pay for it. At last he thought it high time
to compromise matters with his commandaut, who now receives on each
occasion a fixed sum of 200 ducats.”—P. 14
But here is the Emperor himself, the man who rules from China to
Germany, and from the North Pole to Persia: —
“ The Admiralty is surrounded by a boulevard and double row of trees.

jesty,’ is the response that comes thundering in unison from thousands of
throats.”—P. 34.
The Emperor has no sinecure:—
A stranger has no occasion, however, to go to the parade, if his object
is merely to see the Emperor, who may be met with on foot, on horseback,
in a droshky, in all parts of St Petersburg, and at every hour of the

day. There is no other monarch w ho appears to have so much business
to do in the streets as the successor of Peter the Great. There are public
institutions to be inspected, the offices of the different departments of
government to be visited, reviews to be held, national festivals at which
he is expected to attend, new buildings to be superintended, not to speak
of the many private visits paid to those whom he is disposed to honour
with so high a mark of favour.”
Like the early Roman emperors, he seeks to disarm envy by avoiding

The following account is an interesting proof of his influence over
his subjects. The circumstance occurred
“In 1832, when the cholera raged in St Petersburg, and when the

excited by the ir own absurd sus picions, broke out one morning into open
insurrection. The frantic mob of graybeards ran wildly about the neigh-
bouring streets, seized upon the cholera carts, made the patients get out,
set the horses loose, and after breaking the vehic es threw the fragments
into the Fontanka, and then fortified the market place by erecting barri-
cades of hay waggons at the several entrances. The insurgents passed the
night behind their intrenchments, and resolved, on the following morning,
to deal with the doctors as they . ud dealt with the earts. Early in the
morning, acco the great cholera h« was attacked and taken
by storm. Tl mostly Germans, were thrown from the win-

individual belonging to the “ black people,” the Russian term for the
lower orders :—
“At the first glance there is something exceedingly repulsive in the
Russian mushik. His hair is long and shaggy, and so is his beard; his
person is dirty, he is always noisy ; and when wrapped up in his sheepskin
he certainly presents a figure more suitable for a bandit or a murderer
than for a man devoted to peaceable occupations. This apparent rudeness,
however, is less a part of the man himself than of his hair and beard, of
his shaggy sheepskin, and the loud deep tone of his voice. The stranger
who is able to address him with kindness in his native language, soon dis-
covers in the mushik a good-humoured, friendly, harmless, and serviceable
creature. ‘Good day, “brothe r, how goes it? * *Good day, father, thank
God it goes well with me. What is your pleasure? How can I serve
you?’ And at these words his face unbends into a simpering smile, the
hat is taken off, the glove drawn from the hand, bow follows bow, and he
will catch your hand with native politeness and good-humoured cor-
diality.”—P. 63.
Though good-humoured and polite, however, sad to say, the mushik,
according to our author, is apt to be both a cheat andasot. Heisa
clever fellow, too, as the following anecdote will prove:—
“The Emperor wished to illuminate the Alexander column in a grand
style, the size of the round lamps was indicated, and the glasses bespoken
at the St Petersburg manufactory, where the workmen exerted themselves
in vain, and almost blew the breath out of their bodies in the endeavour
to obtain the desired magnitude. The commission must be executed, that
was self-evident, but how? A great premium was offered to whoever
should solve this problem. Again the human bellows toiled and puffed,
their object seemed unattainable, when at last a long-bearded Russian
stepped forward and declared that he could do it: he had strong and
sound lungs, he would only rinse his mouth first with a little cold water to
refresh them. He applied his mouth to the pipe, and puffed to such pur-
pose that the vitreous ball swelled and swelled nearly to the required
dimensions, up to it, beyond it. ‘ Hold, hold,’ cried the lookers on, ‘ you
are doing too much, and how did you do it at all? ’—‘ The matter is sim-
ple enough,’ said the long-beard; ‘but first, where is my premium?’
And when he had clutched the promised bounty he explained. He had
retained some of the water in his mouth, which had passed thence into the
glowing ball, and there becoming steam, had rendered him this good
service.”
Mr Kohl gives us a portrait of our countrymen in St Petersburg;
we should say the resemblance was good.
“The English form a colony apart yet more than the Germans, who
have many Russian subjects among their body ; while the former remain
~ ays the ‘foreign guests,’ who in time of peace share the privilege of the
iatives without p artaking of their burdens. They call their body the St
Pe tersburg Factory. They have their own church, and live secluded
among themselves, de ‘spising all other nations, and more particularly their
hosts the Russi: ans; drive English equipages; hunt the bear on the shores
of the Neva as they do the tiger on the banks of the Ganges; decline
taking off their hats to the Emperor, and looking down on all men, boast
of their own indispensableness and their iny incible fleet.”
As they look down on the Russians, so do the latter look up to
them.
“ According to the views of the ordinary Russian, the whole European
world is divided into two parts, into ‘our side’ and ‘your side,’ under
which latter denomination he includes all Europe that is not Russian.
The other half of Europe he also calls the ‘ foreign land,’ and has a general
idea that all within it is of a superior kind, the people particularly excel-
lent, nature extraordinarily beautiful, the productions of art and industry
irreproachable. Thence come those ‘ Inostranzi,’ or foreigners, those wise
people who understand everything better than he does, and from whom
he learns so much.”
We quote the following as a remarkable instance of like effects
following like causes, and of the power of a landed aristocracy, even
in an absolute monarchy, to bend the force of the law to the promo.
tion of their individual interests:
“ The landowners have turned to account their large unemployed capital
of money and serfs, and established manufactories on their own ground,
under the management of their own slaves. All these fairs and markets
of interior Russia are flooded with paper, iron goods, cups, teapots, &c., of
the Demidoffs, Jakowsleffs, Karpzoffs, &c. These mighty influential manu-
facturing aristocrats are in many cases the great obstacles to the improve-
ment of the manufactures by means of the smaller, but more skilful pro-
ducers, who are now quite shut out from competition by the privileged
monopolists. In this respect the Russian aristocracy stand in the same
relation to the manufacturing industry, as the Englis sh aristoc racy do to
the agricultural. In England, where the importation of raw produc e is 80
greatly needed, the sole proprietorship of the soil by the powerful aristo-
cre Ac y not only makes bread dear, but prevents the improvement of agri-
culture. In Russia, where there is a superfluity of raw produce, but a
want of manufactures, the aristocracy manufacturing for themselves have
demanded a high tax on the foreign article, and partly because their social
position gives them a natural predominance; partly because, for the
advancement of some particular branch of industry, they unite to obtain
monopolies from their government, a bar is placed to the invention and
acquisition of the other classes, who, moreover, must pay much dearer for
the necessary manufactures on that very account. "a P, 125.
We here close our extracts. We have taken them from a part only
of the rolume, and we may perhaps, therefore, be tempted to make a
few more on some future occasion. We hope, however, that we have

Memoirs and Notes.
Bentley. 1843.
We have been much disappointed by this book. With the credulity
natural to man, putting faith in the title, we hoped to discover in these
two octavo volumes some evidence of that wit and conversational

talent which the tradition of London society attributes to the name of
George Selwyn. In this hope, and expecting to find it a fit companion
on the library shelf for Horace Walpole and Madame de Sevigné, we
sent for the book. It consists of a great number of letters from a num-
ber of different persons, addressed to George Selwyn, during a period
of thirty years ; but from Selwyn’s own hand there are in the whole
two volumes only seven or eight letters, and the great number of them
entirely relating to business. There is not a vestige of anything which
can enable us to judge of the truth of the tradition above mentioned ;
and, in point of fact, the book has as much claim to be entitled George
Selwyn and his Contemporaries, as Walpok’s Letters to Sir H. Manu

in these letters to compensate for our disappointment.
them consists of the merest gossip, of commissions for the purchase of
silk stockings or china in Paris, and other matters wholly uninterest-
ing. A gossiping letter of our own friends is often interesting, because
it relates to persons and things with which we are familiar, but tittle-
tattle and scandal lose their zest when they concern unimportant per-
sonages many years dead, buried, and forgotten. No
farthing whether Lady A. was civil to Mr B. a century ago, or that
Lord C. thought of marrying Miss D., who was great grandmother to
Mrs F. Who is amused, interested, or pleased at learning that Lord
March, in 1766, had changed his mistress, or that Mr Williams was
willing to invest five pounds in a pair of French ruffles? Details such
as these, to have any interest with posterity, must concern great per-
sonages, with whom fame has made us acquainted, and regarding whom
we wish to know every particular, however trifling; or they must
relate to persons whom we ourselves know; or, lastly, they may be
written with such a charm of style as to please on that account, with-
out reference to their subject matter. Few of these letters, as we
think, can be put under any one of the heads of exception to the
general rule which we have laid down above ; a few, perhaps, but a
few only, may be saved from condemnation under the third. We were
rather amused with the following note to Selwyn, who had lately suc-
ceeded his father as member for Gloucester. The duties of the mem-
ber for an important city were certainly somewhat different ninety
years ago from what they are now. My Alderman Harris writes in
1752 from Gloucester :—
“ Sir,—At the request of Mr Mayor, whose extraordinary hurry of busi-
ness will not afford him leisure to write himself, I am desired to acquaint
you, that by the Gloucester waggon this week is sent the usual present
of a lamprey pie from this corporation to H. R. H. the Prince of Wales.
It is directed to you, and I am further to request the favour of you to have
the same presented, with the compliments of this body, as your late father
used to do.”—Vol. i, p. 153.
What recollection of good old times does this note call up! How sad
to think that they have passed away! Alas! for Albert Edward
Prince of Wales, no Berkeley or Philpotts is now directed to present
him with lamprey pie. But all things are not changed since those
times, Oxford, for instance :
“T cannot help casting my eyes on that part of your letter, where you
seem to think the people of Oxford had principles; this really astonishes
me, for you must know they never had any, moral or divine; party only
governs.” —Vol. i, p. 85.
There were Waterfords, too, in those days. Mr Scrope writes—
“ After drinking four bottles, which had made me mad, and the rest of
the company drunk, I strapped and carried Baron Newman, alias Crook-
fingered Jack, in a chair, quite up to the end of Joy’s long room, at nine
o’clock, where all the company then in Tunbridge were assembled. I tore
open the door and top of the chair, and down he dropped, to all appearance
adead man. Miss Chadleigh fainted, and was carried off. This spread
among the ladies like a contagion. I am informed of eight at least who
fell into fits.”
County members may take a hint from the following.
Bunbury, a celebrated beauty, writes—
“ We think and talk of nothing but elections. Sir Charles’s (her hus-
band’s) county meeting is to-morrow, where he expects an opposition, and
the day after we both set out, he to go to one side of the county, and I on
the other, to canvass.”
The first Lord Holland, no mean judge, speaks thus of two men who
were both first ministers of the crown. Of George Grenville :
“7 do not wonder when I see sensible men with strong prejudices, but
it does surprise me, when they are in favour of a conceited fellow, whom one
can neither see nor hear without disgust, and who noddles his head so, and
is so tedious,”—Vol. ii, p. 24.
The Duke of Newcastle :
“His Grace had no friends and deserved none. He had no rancour: no
ill nature, which I think much to his honour: but though a very good
quality, it is only a negative one, and he had absolutely no one positive
good, either of his heart or head.”—Vol. ii, p. 269.
We have a saddening picture of the feelings of a deserted statesman
in these lines, from the hand of the same great man:
“J never envied Mr Yorke whilst he lived, but I must take leave to
envy him, and everybody else, when they are dead.” —Vol. ii, p. 378.
We will conclude our extracts with something less melancholy. He
who, when alive, is said to have made so many laugh by his wit, can,
when dead, we think, fairly claim a smile from us, by the following
evidence of his weakness. A correspondent writes to Selwyn:
“ Your old maid-servant desired I would, with her humble duty, let you
know that the little dog is very well, and that she continues to sleep with
it at my Lord Carlisle’s, lest the smell of the paint should hurt it.”
We fear, besides affording proof of such harmless weakness as this,
that the perusal of these letters leads us to an inference that Selwyn

‘ . TY r MISCELLANEOUS.
TurN-ouT oF SEAMEN IN LiveRPooLt.—A turn-out has taken place
among the seamen of this port of a somewhat formidable character, as to
the numbers who have already joined in it, and also as regards the deter-
mined manner in which they seem bent on accomplishing their purpose.
It commenced very unexpectedly at noon on Thursday, when about 200
seamen marched in a body towards the west front of the Custom-house,
where they halted, formed a sort of meeting, and proceeded to inveigh
most strongly against an exorbitant charge to which they alleged they had
been subjected at what are called the shipping offices of the port. They
complain of the exactions of the agents with whom ships are manned.
A Wiryess Reprovep.—Are you always in the house? said Mr Wat-
son to a witness in a libel case. Witness: Nearly so, except when I go to
the news-room. Mr Watson: You are perhaps a conscientious reader of
a newspaper. (Laughter.) You read all the debates and advertisements
through. Witness: No, nor lawyer’s jargon, either. Mr Justice Cress-
well: Witness, I do not know what the jury think of that sort of conduct,
but to me it adds little to the value of a witness’s evidence. Witness:
It was rather a queer question, my Lord. Mr Justice Cresswell (sharply) :
What, to ask you whether you read the debates? Don’t give such an
excuse as that for your impertinence.
An Usrortunate Name.—On Friday Mr Rotch applied to the judge
to allow a cause to stand over for an hour or two under the following cir-
cumstances:—He said, my Lord, there is a witness in this case named
John Jones, who has to come from Wales. On Wednesday the parties
expected they had all the witnesses here ready for the trial. They sent
over *a subpeena for John Jones, but as you are aware, my Lord, that is
rather an unfortunate name in Wales; when John Jones arrived it was
found that he was not the right John Jones. Another subpcena was sent
for the proper John Jones, and we have intimation that he will arrive by
the packet at three o’clock this afternoon, and as it is highly necessary
that the genuine John Jones should be here, I hope you will allow the
cause to stand over. His lordship joined in the laugh occasioned by this
statement, and allowed the case to stand over.
A LAwyYeEr’s Oprnion oF Size.—In a case involving a breach of contract,
Mr Knowles was arguing that in consequence of a bar having been placed
across the inside of an iron pan, the pan was thereby made larger. Mr
Justice Cresswell: I cannot think that a pan is larger because it has iron
bars placed across it inside. Mr Knowles: Undoubtedly, my Lord; I think
that if *you make an article which contains more iron, it is larger. Mr
Justice Cresswell; Suppose you were to fill the pan with iron, would you
say the pan was larger then? Mr Knowles: Certainly, I should, “my
Lord. (Laughter.)
CauTIon TO WitNesses.—There can no greater infliction upon
judge, jury, and counsel than the putting into the witness-box a person
who will not speak up. It is one of the greatest nuisances which attend
our courts of justice. The other day, one of these mumbling individuals
was called to give evidence in a case touching the efficiency of a machine.
Mr Justice Cresswell strongly remonstrated with the witness; the oppos-
ing counsel called, “Speak out;” the jury said, “Can’t hear;” and the
leading counsel coaxed; but all in vain, the witness could not be heard.
Mr Cowling, who was leading, said at last, “ Why can’t you speak out;
you Mr Justice Cresswell: “I have remon-
transferred for a consideration to the hands of a publisher.
be
none of us can hear?”
strated with him all I can, but it is of no use, and I hope he won’t speak
up for you, as he would not speak up for me. I must repeat what I have
before said, that I have always very great suspicion of a witness who will
not‘speak up.” =
Important LeGar Inquiry.—During a trial, on Wednesday last, in
the Crown Court, Mr Sergeant Murphy had occasion to cross-examine a
female witness as to the existence of the mafriage contract, which the
learned counsel appeared to consider of rather a questionable character,
when the following colloquy took place :—Mr Wilkins: “I apprehend we
are not here to try the question of the connubial bliss of Mr and Mrs
Mr Sergeant Murphy: “ Not at all—not in the least; but I am
unacquainted with connubial bliss, unfortunately, and I want to know
what sort of thing it is.” e o
Visits oF BENEVOLENCE TO THE TWO UNIVERSITIES.—It is announced
that Mr Bright and his friends are to visit Oxford early in the ensuing
month, for the purpose of promulgating free-trade doctrines in that famous
University city. It is only to be regretted that this very useful mission
has been undertaken during the long vacation, instead of during term, as,
owing to the absence of the great body of the gownsmen just now from
their Alma Mater, they will be prevented profiting by the information
which Mr Bright has the power of imparting.—It is also stated that the
sister University town of Cambridge is shortly to be the scene of Father
Mathew’s labours in the cause of temperance. Again we have to regret
that an extremely important subject will not be presented to the atten-
tion of our Universities by reason of their necessary absence from their
proper place of study at this season of the year.
Great Turn-out oF Mrners.—The colliery proprietors of West Cum-
berland, understanding that there was a general strike agreed upon by
their workmen to take place on the Ist of October, last week held a meet-
ing, and came to the resolution not to admit any one into their pit until
he had renounced the Union. This brought on at once the stand-out, and
at present the pits in the whole of the district are standing still.
— Higginson, who was convitted at the late assizes for the brutal
murder of his child, was executed on Saturday morning, at eight o’clock,
in front of the county goal, Stafford, in the presence of an immense con-
course of persons.
RamsGare, Ava. 30.—Yesterday the annual regatta took place at Mar-

This Institution is empowered by a special Act of Parlia-
ment, and is so constituted as to afford the benefits of Life |
Assurance in their fullest extent to Policy-holders, and to |
present greater facilities and acg@ammodation than are usually
offered by other Companies.
Assurances may either be effected by Parties on their own
Lives, or by Parties interested therein on the Lives of Others.
Theeffect of an Assurance on a person's own life is to create
at once a Property in Reversion, which can by no other means
be realized. ‘ake, for instance, the case of a person at the
age of Thirty, who, by the payment of 5/. 3s. 4d. to the Bri-
tannia Life Assurance Company, can become at once possessed
of a bequeathable property, amounting to 1,0002., subject only
to the condition of his continuing the same payment quarterly
during the remainder of his life—a condition which may be
fulfilled by the mere saving of Eight Shillings weekly in his
expenditure. Thus, by the exertion of a very slight degree of
economy—such indeed, as can scarcely be felt as an inconve-
nience, he may at once realise a capital of 1,0002., which he
can bequeath or dispose of in any way he may think proper.
A Table of Decreasing Rates of Premium ona novel and

continuing the payment of all further Premiums after

MANCHESTER
T HE TIMES.
A FREE-TRADE NEWSPAPER.
Published every Saturday, by Prentice and Cathrall, Dusic
place, Manchester.
The MANCHESTER TIMES was established less as a busi-
ness speculation than as a means of promoting the principles
of Civil, Religious, and Commercial Liberty ; and every great
political and social reform, in a period of unusual advance-
ment, has received its zealous assistance.
In the establishment of new, and the reform of old, Edu-
cational Institutions, it has been eminently useful; and it was
the only paper published in Manchester which opposed the
bilt of Church aggression brought forward by Sir J. Graham,
under the guise of a “‘ Factory Education Bill.”
“* It was the only paper in Manchester which devoted its
space tothe proceedings of the Anti-Slavery Society, and the
editorial articles which appeared from time to time were not
uninfluential in forming that public opinion which effected
the emancipation of the negroes in our colonies.
It took the lead of all the provincial papers in opposition to
Church Rates, and is now the only paper in Manchester which
traces all such exactions to their source—the unhappy con-
nexion of Church and State
It was the only provincial paper in the kingdom which ex
posed that iniquitous monopoly of the King’s Printer and the
Universities, which made the Bible double the price at which,
since the destruction of the monopoly in Scotland, it is now
published.
Its expositions of the old representative system previous to
the proposal of the Reform Bill were of acknowledged utility ;
and, since the passing of that great but still imperfect mea-
sure, it has not ceased to advocate a fuller and more complete
representation of the people, with full protection to the voter
from the exercise of undue influences.
It has unceasingly been the earnest advocate of perfect free-
dom of Trade, not only for its direct benefits, but as a means
of promoting universal peace ; and it is not too much to affirm
that the lead which Manchester has taken in the present great
movement against the landowners’ monopoly may, in a con-
siderable degree, be attributed to che effect produced upon the
public mind by the constantly-repeated expositions in the
MANCHESTER Times of the mischiefs inflicted by the corn
laws.
Such was the course pursued when the proprietors were in
advance of public opinion, and when they had to struggle
with difficulties which would have overwhelmed men of less
attachment to principle and less determination to carry out
the views which they were pledged to maintain. That such a
course has been pursued, under such circumstances, is no
slight guarantee, that now, with fewer temptations to expe-
diency, Civil, Religious, and Commercial Liberty will con-
tinue to be promoted with unabated zeal and energy
